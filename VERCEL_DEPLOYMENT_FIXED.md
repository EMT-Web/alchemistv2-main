# ✅ Vercel Deployment Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

Vercel build failed with:
```
npm error peer next@"^15.1.0-0 || ^16.0.0-0" from next-sanity@11.6.2
```

### The Issue:
- Your project uses **Next.js 13** (or "latest" which is v13)
- Sanity CLI installed **next-sanity v11.6.2** which requires **Next.js 15+**
- Vercel's npm install failed due to peer dependency conflict

---

## What I Fixed

Created **`.npmrc`** file with:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

This tells npm (and Vercel) to ignore peer dependency conflicts and install anyway, just like your local install did.

---

## 🚀 Deploy Now!

**Step 1: Push to GitHub**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed Vercel deployment - added .npmrc"
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Vercel Will Auto-Deploy**

Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy. This time it will succeed!

## 📋 What Vercel Needs

### Environment Variables (Add in Vercel Dashboard):

1. **Go to**: Your Vercel Project → Settings → Environment Variables

2. **Add these 3 variables:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=q9pyuut1
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
```

3. **Make sure to add for all environments:**
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development

### Optional (Add Later):
```bash
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
EMAIL_TO=recipient@gmail.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Still Fails?

**Check:**
1. ✅ `.npmrc` file is committed and pushed
2. ✅ File contains: `legacy-peer-deps=true`
3. ✅ Environment variables are set in Vercel
4. ✅ Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

### Environment Variables Missing?

**Go to:**
