# ✅ All Null Check Errors Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

All dynamic pages (tours, destinations, blog) were trying to access properties on potentially `null` objects before checking if they exist.

### Errors Fixed:

1. ❌ `pages/destinations/[slug].tsx` - Line 233: `destination.related` before null check
2. ❌ `pages/tours/[slug].tsx` - Line 317: `tour.related` before null check  
3. ❌ `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` - Line 238: `post.related` before null check

---

## What I Fixed

### All 3 Pages Now:

1. ✅ **Check if data exists FIRST**
2. ✅ **Return 404 if missing**
3. ✅ **Use fallback empty array for related items**
4. ✅ **Never crash on null access**

### Code Pattern (Applied to All):

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const data = await sanityClient.fetch(query, { slug })
const related = data.related  // ❌ CRASH if data is null
if (!data) { return notFound }

// AFTER (FIXED):
const data = await sanityClient.fetch(query, { slug })
if (!data) { return notFound }  // ✅ Check first!
const related = data.related || []  // ✅ Safe with fallback
```

## 🚀 Try It Now!

**Restart your dev server:**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

Then test:
- ✅ Click any tour → Should show 404 if doesn't exist (no crash!)
- ✅ Click any destination → Should show 404 if doesn't exist (no crash!)
- ✅ Click any blog post → Should show 404 if doesn't exist (no crash!)

## 📝 About the 404 Errors You're Seeing

### Why You See "Ooops! Not Found":

**You're clicking on category/destination pages that don't have published content in Sanity yet.**

For example:
- `/category/tours-from-marrakesh` → Needs a category called "tours-from-marrakesh" in Sanity
- Tours need to be linked to this category
- Everything must be **PUBLISHED** (not draft)

---

## 🎯 How to Fix "Not Found" Errors

### Option 1: Add Content to Sanity

1. **Go to your Sanity Studio:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/studio
   ```

2. **Create Categories:**
   - Create a category with slug: `tours-from-marrakesh`
   - Create other categories you need

3. **Create Tours:**
   - Add tours
   - Link them to the category
   - Add destinations
   - **PUBLISH** (not draft!)

4. **Test Again:**
   - Go to `/category/tours-from-marrakesh`
   - Should show tours now!

### Option 2: Check What Content You Have

**In Sanity Studio**, check:
- ✅ Do you have tours created?
- ✅ Do you have destinations created?
- ✅ Do you have categories created?
- ✅ Are they all **PUBLISHED**?
- ✅ Are tours linked to categories?
- ✅ Do slugs match the URL?

## 🔍 How to Debug

### Check Your Sanity Data:

1. **Go to Studio**: http://localhost:3000/studio
2. **Click "Vision"** (query tool)
3. **Run this query** to see all tours:
   ```groq
   *[_type == 'tour']{
     title,
     slug,
     categories
   }
   ```

4. **Check if:**
   - Tours exist
   - Slugs are correct
   - They're published (not draft)
