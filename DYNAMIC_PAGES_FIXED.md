# ✅ Fixed! Your Sanity Content Will Now Display

## What Was Wrong

All your dynamic pages (tours, destinations, blog posts, categories) had `fallback: false` in their configuration. This caused:

- ❌ 404 "Not Found" errors when clicking on any tour/destination
- ❌ Only pre-built pages at build time would work
- ❌ New content from Sanity wouldn't appear

## What I Fixed

I changed all dynamic pages from `fallback: false` to `fallback: 'blocking'`:

### Pages Fixed:
1. ✅ **`pages/tours/[slug].tsx`** - Individual tour pages
2. ✅ **`pages/destinations/[slug].tsx`** - Individual destination pages  
3. ✅ **`pages/blog/[slug].tsx`** - Individual blog post pages
4. ✅ **`pages/category/[slug].tsx`** - Category pages
5. ✅ **`pages/destination/[slug].tsx`** - Destination tour listing pages
6. ✅ **`pages/posts/[slug].tsx`** - Post category pages

## What This Means

### Before:
- Click on a tour → 404 Error
- Click on destination → 404 Error
- Content from Sanity → Doesn't show

### After (Now):
- Click on a tour → Loads dynamically from Sanity ✅
- Click on destination → Loads dynamically from Sanity ✅
- New content → Appears automatically ✅

## 🚀 Try It Now!

**Restart your dev server:**

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

Now test:
1. ✅ Go to Tours page
2. ✅ Click on any tour → Should load!
3. ✅ Go to Destinations page
4. ✅ Click on any destination → Should load!
5. ✅ Click on blog posts → Should load!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### If You Still See "Not Found":

This means you don't have published content in Sanity yet. Make sure:

1. **Content is PUBLISHED** in Sanity (not draft)
   - Go to your Sanity Studio
   - Check if tours/destinations have a green "Published" badge
   - If they say "Draft", click "Publish"

2. **Slugs are correct**
   - Each tour/destination needs a unique slug
   - Slug should be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., "3-days-marrakech-tour")

3. **Required fields are filled**
   - Tours need: title, slug, mainImage, duration, destinations
   - Destinations need: title, slug, mainImage, city, body

## 📝 What is `fallback: 'blocking'`?

It tells Next.js:
- "If someone visits a page that doesn't exist yet..."
- "...try to fetch the data from Sanity..."
- "...and build the page on-demand"
- "...then serve it to the user"

**Result**: Your Sanity content appears automatically without rebuilding the entire site!
