Clients should take note that Tour Guides and Tour Facilitators are NOT the personal maids of the guests/clients. A tour guide (U.S.) or a tourist guide (European) guides visitors in the language of their choice, provides assistance, information and cultural, historical and contemporary heritage interpretation to people on organized tours and individual clients at educational establishments, religious and historical sites, museums, and at venues of other significant interest. As such, Clients should not expect that the tour guides would personally assist to their every needs. Carrying of Luggage are the responsibility of the clients. Furthermore, a tour guide is also a human person who deserves some respect. Thus, we advise our clients to treat our tour guides with proper respect and decency. </p>
<p> If clients need to reprimand the tour guide, please do so in a decent manner, otherwise, we would be constrained to cancel your tour without any refund.
  We reserve the right to refuse service to any person or business who may refuse to comply with our safety instructions, our tour itinerary, or to anyone who may pose a threat to our customers and/or our tour guide-drivers. Screaming at or insulting tour guides/drivers or fellow passengers or third-party businesses and subcontractors is NOT ACCEPTABLE under any circumstances and will terminate and cancel your tour without any refund. Discrimination against a customer or a tour guide/driver for any reason is not acceptable either under any circumstance.
