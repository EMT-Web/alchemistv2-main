# ✅ Serialization Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The category page (`/category/[slug]`) was trying to return `undefined` for the `category` prop, which Next.js cannot serialize as JSON.

### The Error:
```
Error: `undefined` cannot be serialized as JSON. 
Please use `null` or omit this value.
```

### The Cause:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN):
category: tours[0]?.category[0]!,  // Returns undefined if category doesn't exist
```

The `!` operator tells TypeScript "trust me, this exists", but at runtime it can still be `undefined`.

## What I Fixed

Changed the code to properly handle missing data:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED):
const category = tours[0]?.category?.[0] || null;  // Returns null if missing
```

### Also added:
- Better check for empty tours array
- Clear null fallback
- Proper error handling

## 🚀 Try It Now!

**Restart your dev server:**

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

Then test:
1. ✅ Go to any category page
2. ✅ Should load without errors!
3. ✅ No more serialization errors!

---

## 📋 Complete Status

All serialization issues fixed in:
- ✅ `pages/category/[slug].tsx` - Fixed
- ✅ `pages/posts/[slug].tsx` - Already had proper null handling
- ✅ All other pages - No issues found

---

## 🎯 What This Means

### Before:
- Category pages → Serialization error ❌
- Undefined values → Crash ❌

### After (Now):
- Category pages → Load properly ✅
- Missing data → Uses null (no crash) ✅
- Proper error handling ✅

**Your site should now work perfectly! Restart the dev server and test it!** 🎉
