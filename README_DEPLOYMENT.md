```bash
# Sanity CMS
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sanity_auth_token_here

# Google Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=your_google_analytics_id

# Email (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password

NODE_ENV=production
```

2. Select your project
3. Copy the **Project ID**
4. Go to API → Tokens → Add New Token
5. Create a token with "Editor" permissions
6. Dataset is usually "production"

## 🧪 Test Locally First

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

If the build succeeds locally, it will succeed on Vercel!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel

**Issue**: Build fails with TypeScript errors  
**Solution**: The linter errors you see locally are false positives. They will resolve after `npm install`. If build fails on Vercel, check:
- All environment variables are set correctly
- No typos in variable names
- Variables are added to "Production" environment

**Issue**: "Cannot find module 'next-optimized-images'"  
**Solution**: Already fixed! Run `npm install` to update dependencies

### Contact Form Not Working

**Issue**: Form submits but no email received  
**Solution**:
- Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are correct
- Use Gmail App Password, not your regular password
- Check Vercel Functions logs for errors

### Images Not Loading

**Issue**: Images show broken  
**Solution**:
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` is correct
- Check that images are published in Sanity
- Verify `cdn.sanity.io` is in `next.config.js` domains

### Content Not Showing

**Issue**: Tours/destinations/blog posts are empty  
**Solution**:
- Check Sanity dataset name is "production"
- Verify content is published in Sanity (not draft)
- Check `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` has read permissions

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
