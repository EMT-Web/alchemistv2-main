## Consistency Check ✅

**All inquiry/contact forms now use:**
- ✅ Professional, action-oriented language
- ✅ "Tailor-Made Itinerary" (emphasizes customization)
- ✅ "Designed to Your Preferences" (personal touch)
- ✅ Consistent messaging across entire site

---

## Other Form Text (Unchanged - These are fine)

**Contact Page Hero:**
> "Let us design a tour that takes you to Morocco's most beautiful and lesser-known destinations..."

This is different from the form text and is appropriately descriptive.

**Tour Detail Form:**
> "Let Us Take You on a Journey Through Time and Culture in Morocco"

This is a tagline/motto and is different from the inquiry text.
